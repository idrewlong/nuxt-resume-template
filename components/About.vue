			For six years, I worked as a Senior UX Consultant at Spiegel Institut,
			supporting Porsche's Navigation team. I handled specifications, guided
			designers, and collaborated with developersâ€”building a strong UX
			foundation. Fueled by a passion for hands-on design, I upskilled at night,
			landing my first Product Designer role at Turbo in Q4 2024.
